Azure Resource manager model

 Resources - Resource Group
    The benefits of using Resource Manager With Resource Manager, you can:
        1. Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
        2. Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
        3. Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
        4. Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
        5. Apply access control to all services because Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
        6. Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
